    <p>Teotihuacan /teɪˌoʊtiːwəˈkɑːn/,[1] (in Spanish: Teotihuacán) (Spanish pronunciation: [teotiwa'kan] ,is an ancient Mesoamerican city located in a sub-valley of the Valley of Mexico, located in the State of Mexico 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of modern-day Mexico City, known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas</p>
    <p>Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead and its vibrant murals that have been exceptionally well-preserved. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools that are found throughout Mesoamerica.</p>
    <p>Teotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Highlands around the first century AD. It became the largest and most populated center in the pre-Columbian Americas. Teotihuacan was even home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate this large population.[2] The term Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacano) is also used for the whole civilization and cultural complex associated with the site.</p>
